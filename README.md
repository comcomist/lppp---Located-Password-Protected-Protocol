# lppp---Located-Password-Protected-Protocol under the [humanitarian-agpl-license](http://namzezam.wikidot.com/humanitarian-agpl-license)
strengthening the user's key with her/his extra knowledge about the protected object.
rational:
*	location implement meta-data and act of categorization
*	just randomizing is attracted and it is hard for user memorize
*	user can categorize pass  per more general location...., starting with no categorization meaning with 1 pass for all, even in which case still each object is protected by different key!




The lppp - Located Password Protected Protocol, using aes256((key^data), as key=scrypt(password,pointer_to_data), e.g for pointer: indicator for discussion, pointer to buffer, url or The path with file name to data, aka the  lppf - Located Password Protected Files:
* **1.** in NoHomDear: each file named=scrypt(B) contains B=aes256(k=scrypt(pass,path)^A)
* **2.** out of NoHomeDear and on external device : one lppf file mapping the named->path[,pass]
* **3.** in NoHomeUrl, p2p like dat and or on server like transfer.sh/share.riseup.net 
*   at the Url U linking to C=aes256(scrypt(G,T,P)^(U,k)) 
*   being shared in the group G discussing the topic T with the password P, 
*  while using protocols such as omEom or openPgp,
*  while   named!=scrypt(B), B is only a part and in its last 4 bytes is the size of its linker including the information allowing
 
files could to be cut, redundant and inflated, being encrypted by scrypt(G,T,P) and having:
*	  the position of this part and its noise_size and the link to the next part, its availability (how long to wait) and its expiration date.
